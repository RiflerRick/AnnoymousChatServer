    `We have this idea of replicating this stupid bug in the telecommunication
    systems of Sweden, that was widely used in 1982 when you dialed a number that was not
    connected nobody had had that number yet everybody else that called that same number
    also heard everybody else on the line. It was kind of basically a voice group chat
    that was a completely unintentional usage of the system. This became a thing, This
    was pre-internet so nobody had any place to meet online because online didn't exist. This
    was the closest thing to online that occurred, This was primarily a popular among youth`
