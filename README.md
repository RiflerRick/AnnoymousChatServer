    `we have this idea of replicating is stupid thing me a stupid bug in the telecommunication
    systems of Sweden that was widely used in 1982 when you dialed a number that was not
    connected nobody had had that number yet everybody else that called that same number
    also heard everybody else on the line so it was kind of basically a voice group chats
    that was a completely unintentional usage of the system this this became a thing this
    was pre-internet so nobody had any place to meet online because online didn't exist this
    was the closest thing that occurred this was primarily a popular among youth`
